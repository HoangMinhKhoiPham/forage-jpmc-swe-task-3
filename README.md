# JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Internship

Welcome to the JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Internship! This repository contains solutions to the tasks provided during the internship, demonstrating proficiency in software engineering concepts and problem-solving skills.

## Task 1: Stock Price Analysis

### Purpose
Process the data feed of stock A and stock B's price to enable analysis for trading.

### Acceptance Criteria
- `getDataPoint` function returns correct tuple of stock name, bid price, ask price, and price.
- `getRatio` function returns the ratio of the two stock prices.
- `main` function outputs correct stock info, prices, and ratio.

## Task 2: Client-Side Web Application Fix

### Purpose
Fix the client-side web application to display a continuously updating line graph of stock data.

### Acceptance Criteria

## Task 3: Live Perspective Graph Generation

### Purpose
Generate a live graph to display the data feed for traders to monitor potential trading opportunities.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The numbers from the python script render properly in the live perspective graph.
- The graph tracks and displays the ratio between two stock prices.
- Upper and lower bounds are shown on the graph.
- An alert is displayed whenever the bounds are crossed.

## Conclusion
